### Installing

Once you have installed flutter and successfuly setup your flutter environment you can run our 
app in the CLI. These commands will work regardless of your environment.

#### Local installation

If you already have the directory on your device just open the CLI and change into the project directory.
Then follow the steps after the repository is cloned.

#### Installing from remote

Open the CLI and change into the directory you wish to work in.
Then run the following command
